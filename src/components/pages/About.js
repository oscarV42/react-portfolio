            <p>
            I'm a hispanic web developer currently enrolled in Georgia Tech coding
            Bootcamp. Technologies I use for web development are HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript/JQuery, Express.js, Node.js, and MYSQL. I have some
            experience in Visual Basics and C/C++ from attending Edmonds Community
            College. Web development is an art and I love to see all the progress
            from creating and collaborating on projects. I don't have any
            professional work experience in this field but I'm open to new
            opportunities.
